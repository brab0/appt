# @appt/mongoose
This is a plugin made for Appt that wraps [Mongoose ODM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) to work into the *Appt's ecosystem* with advanced *database models and schemes*. 
We assume you got here after seeing the [Appt's Main Page](https://github.com/brab0/appt). If you don't, **we strongly recommend** you to step back an take a 5 minutes reading to get used with some key concepts we're going to apply here.


## Install
    $ npm install @appt/mongoose --save

 
## Resources
The `@appt/mongoose` plugin export some resources which can be imported as seen below:
```javascript
import {
	Mongoose,
	TModel,
	TSchema,
	SchemaTypes,
	MongooseParse
} from '@appt/mongoose';
```

### Mongoose
At the example below, we have a component that needs to act as a database connector of an application. By default, an Appt component is just a class with a "signature" that it can be injected by other class. As our component here needs to a specific behavior, we need to make use of a *Special-Type Extender* called *TDatabase*. This special type makes part of the [@appt/core](https://github.com/brab0/appt/tree/master/core) package and it indicates our component should act as a database connector but also, it does not know *how or which kind of database to connect*? To this point we need to use a *"driver"*, which here is the *"Mongoose"*.  As the simple usage below shows, after `use` the Mongoose driver, you only need to provide the `uri` connection. If you need a little more configuration, you can set if you want to debug the connection *(default: false)* or even pass into options attribute any param allowed by the mongoose connection.
```javascript
import { ApptComponent, TDatabase } from '@appt/core';
import { Mongoose } from '@appt/mongoose';

@ApptComponent({
	extend: {
		type: TDatabase,
		use: [Mongoose],
		config: {
			uri: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/appt-demo',
			debug:  true,
			options: {
				keepAlive: true
			}
		}
	}
})
export class AppDatabase(){}
```

### TModel
This Special-Type Extender add the Mongoose Model behavior to our component. That means once imported by another component (or even inside the model), any *mongoose/mongo* query method can be accessed into the class context. After define the type as a TModel component, the mongoose model expect it to has a mongoose schema as well. To get there, just `use: ['TheSchema']` . You also can add any config allowed in a mongoose model by passing them into the config attribute.
```javascript
import { ApptComponent } from '@appt/core';
import { TModel } from '@appt/mongoose';

@ApptComponent({
	extend: {
		type: TModel,
		use: ['TheSchema'],
		config: {}
	}
})
export class TheModel(){
	constructor()
	{
	}

	static getById(_id){
		return this.findOne({ _id: _id });
	}
}
```

### TSchema
The special type to transform a component into a Mongoose Schema. All the configurations accepted by mongoose can be passed into the config attribute.
```javascript
import { ApptComponent } from '@appt/core';
import { TSchema } from '@appt/mongoose';

@ApptComponent({
	extend: {
		type: TSchema,
		config: {}
	}
})
export class AppShema(){
	constructor(){
		this.name = {
			type: String,
			trim: true,
			default: "",
		}

		this.email = {
			type: String,
			trim: true,
			default: "",
		}
	}
}
```

### SchemaTypes
This is an Appt interface for Mongoose ODM schema types. It exposes every type available in Mongoose.
```javascript
import { SchemaTypes } from '@appt/mongoose';
...
	this._id = {
		type: SchemaTypes.ObjectId,
		require: true
	}
...
```

### MongooseParse
This is an Appt interface for Mongoose ODM type parsers. It exposes every parser available by Mongoose.

```javascript
import { MongooseParse } from '@appt/mongoose';
...
	getById(myId){
		return this.findOne({
			_id: MongooseParse.ObjectId(myId)
		})
	}
...
```

## Compatibility
**We're using ES6 features!** Which means you gonna need to compile your code to work with current versions of **NodeJs**. Thankfully, there's a lot of tools out there doing that, such as [babel](https://babeljs.io/).
You might also want to work with **TypeScript**. If you do, check the *experimental decorators support* option to start coding.


## That's all folks!
If you have any suggestion or want to contribute somehow, let me know!
